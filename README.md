# C-Systems-Programming
An incomplete collection of various C code I've written for a Systems Programming Course.

This class covered system-level programming with an emphasis on C programming, process management and small scale concurrency with multi-threaded programming. Special attention was given to careful memory management via full understanding of internal memory structures. Debugging facilities both in a sequential and parallel setting were also covered.
